     This message requests the SC to re-transmit its last message.  It is sent by the ACS to the SC when the checksum in a received message does not match the value calculated by the ACS.  The SC should respond by re-transmitting its last message, This message should never include a “sequence number” field, even when error detection is enabled, (see “Checksums and Sequence Numbers” below) but would include a “checksum” field since checksums are in use.
